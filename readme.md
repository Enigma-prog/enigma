#Enigma - software for astrological research

I started this project in the last days of 2019. 
It is partly a rebuild of a previous project built in Free Pascal but I decided to switch to Java.
The main reason for my switch was that JavaFX is still being supported very well, despite of being removed from the official Oracle runtime.
The code in it's current state is not usable. Astronomical calculations are functioning but I did not work on the UI yet.

You can download it as a Maven project but you need to download the files of the Swiss Ephemeris and the Java port to that ephemeris to get the program running.
I will shortly add the necessary information.
